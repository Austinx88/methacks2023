Inspiration
Originally, we wanted to make an AI dating app based on characters, including Drake, Shakespeare, and a generic programmer. This app was our passion, at least until Sunday, when we realized we could not finish on time. Our group then agreed on making a discord bot, using our trained models. We used Drake as the cover, as his model was the most recognizable. Lots of our code related with the cohere api also transferred over.

What it does
It is a discord bot, where you can speak directly to (AI) Drizzy, as well as its other personalities. There are also more personalities, which are created through a prompt the bot is given by a user. These user bots can be spoken to by other users.

How we built it
The bot was made using Disnake Python library as well as the Cohere Python API.

Challenges we ran into
As this was our first hackathon, and basically our first experience, we were a little overly ambitious. Our original plan was a dating app which users would date through training their own AI character. Called Rizzify, these characters would talk to each other through text-generated 'rizz' (basically just a conversation) given prompts. This was going to be done as a React app. These plans fell apart as it was far more difficult than we thought. We planned out priorities of what needed to be done and such, but the tasks at hand were too difficult for our inexperienced selves. We then moved to a Discord bot, which faced its own fair share of difficulties. One large challenge with bot was that the Drake model learned many bad words that are not found in any training. Unfortunately, we were not able to fix that issue, and thus we cannot demonstrate this feature live at the project showcase. On the other hand, we were luckily able to get past many other issues, and have gotten way further than we would have with the original dating app idea.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We all really liked the design and idea of the original dating app. We started making the React app, which looked really clean. It is still on the same GITHUB project, just not being used. The Discord bot works to some extend and we all think is is pretty neat.

What we learned
While being ambitious is good, being too ambitious is not good. As learnt in CPS412 ethics, a virtue is between two vices. We should have branched out just slightly instead of something like the dating app, which we had no idea how to approach. As our team member Chris says, "don't bite off more than you can chew".

What's next for this project?
We want to split up the github projects, and finish the dating app idea whilst not restricted to the Hackathon time frame.
