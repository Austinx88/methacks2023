# Methacks 2023 Project
Originally, we wanted to make an AI dating app based on characters, including Drake, Shakespeare, and a generic programmer. This app was our passion, at least until Sunday, when we realized we could not finish on time. Our group then agreed on making a discord bot, using our trained models. We used Drake as the cover, as his model was the most recognizable. Lots of our code related with the cohere api also transferred over.

## What it does
It is a discord bot, where you can speak directly to (AI) Drizzy, as well as its other personalities. There are also more personalities, which are created through a prompt the bot is given by a user. These user bots can be spoken to by other users.

## How we built it
The bot was made using Disnake Python library as well as the Cohere Python API.

## What we learned
While being ambitious is good, being too ambitious is not good. As learnt in CPS412 ethics, a virtue is between two vices. We should have branched out just slightly instead of something like the dating app, which we had no idea how to approach. As our team member Chris says, "don't bite off more than you can chew".

## What's next for this project?
We want to split up the github projects, and finish the dating app idea whilst not restricted to the Hackathon time frame.

## How to run
Download disnake  `pip install disnake`
Run main file `python main.py`
